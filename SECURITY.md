# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it **privately**. Do not open a public issue.

- **GitHub private security advisory**  
  Go to the repository → Security → Advisories → “Report a vulnerability”.
- **Email**  
  Use any contact address the project publishes for security reports.

We use reports to evaluate and fix issues. We aim to keep reports confidential until a fix is released.

## Scope

- Vulnerabilities that can be reproduced in **this repository’s front-end code** (thegentlelight-web)
- Examples: XSS, auth bypass, exposure of secrets, known vulnerabilities in dependencies

**Out of scope:** Attacks that only target backend APIs, infrastructure, or third-party services not in this repo. Please report those to the relevant service’s security contact when possible.

## Acknowledgments

We may thank reporters (anonymously if preferred) after a fix is published. Tell us if you do not want to be credited.
